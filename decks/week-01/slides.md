## Introduction to UNIX/LINUX
### History
- In 1969, a team at Bell Labs laboratories developed a new opearting system named UNIX.
- UNIX was mostly found in large corporations and government environments due to licenses and cost issues.
- In 1991, Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland, started working on a UNIX-like operating system that's free and open-source.


- A community of developers joined the effort and released version 1.0 of the Linux kernel with Torvalds in 1994.
- Today, Linus Torvalds and thousands of collaborators maintain the Linux kernel.
- A large community of developers maintain a large number of Linux distributions or distros, the Linux kernel with a collection of software packages.


- A Linux distribution comprises the Linux kernel, tools and libraries, a window system, and a desktop environment (GUI).
- Hundreds of Linux distributions exist. Some are commercially supported distros for enterprises.
- Popular Linux distributions: 
  - Debian GNU/Linux
    - Ubuntu Linux
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    - CentOS



### Why Linux
- Within cloud computing and server environments, Linux is the operating system for practical reasons:
  - Stable and current
  - Runs on a wide range of architecture
  - Low resource/hardware requirements
  - Uses Unix's modular design
  - Multiuser and multiprocessor support
  - Free and open-source


## Where to host it?
- Private data center
- Public cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - The most practical choice
  - No need to incurr management cost
  - They innovate rapidly
